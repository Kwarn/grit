Design Ideas:<br />
10 rounds<br />
each round unlocks new units<br />
players start with 25 gold<br />
units are brought with gold<br />
cannot see opposite players move until round ends<br />
on turn end units "fire" at each others lines, if able to hit backline player takes damage<br />
random terrain spawns on first load<br />
terrain grants defensive or attacking bonuses<br />
the closer attacking units are to the front line the more damage they do<br />
units can be upgraded by dropping the same unit on itself<br />
closer units to front line fire first <br />
