Design Ideas:
10 rounds
each round unlocks new units
players start with 25 gold
units are brought with gold
cannot see opposite players move until round ends
on turn end units "fire" at each others lines, if able to hit backline player takes damage
random terrain spawns on first load
terrain grants defensive or attacking bonuses
the closer attacking units are to the front line the more damage they do
units can be upgraded by dropping the same unit on itself
closer units to front line fire first
